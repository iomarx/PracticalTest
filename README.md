# Description
A simple app that shows a List of Bank objects. The application fetches the bank list from a given endpoint, then it saves into a CoreData database for further requests.
This application uses the MVVM architectural pattern along with the Repository pattern in order to do the fetching and saving process independent from the ViewModel and the UI.
